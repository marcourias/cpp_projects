# C++ Projects

Welcome to the `cpp_projects` repository! This collection contains various C++ projects, each designed to demonstrate specific programming concepts and techniques. Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a brief overview, usage instructions, and relevant code files.

Feel free to explore the different projects and learn from their implementations. If you have ideas for improvements or would like to contribute, please follow the guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

## Project 1: Stack and Queue Implementation

This project implements a stack and a queue data structure, offering various operations for managing and interacting with these data structures.

### Main Features

- **Stack Operations**: Push values onto the stack, search for values, find the smallest and largest values, and pop elements.
- **Queue Operations**: Enqueue values into the queue, search for values, find the smallest and largest values, and dequeue elements.
- **Input Validation**: Input is carefully validated to ensure it meets the required conditions, promoting a smooth and error-free user experience.
- **Modular Structure**: The code is organized into modular functions, each responsible for specific operations, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Getting Started

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. **Compilation**: Compile the program using a C++ compiler. If you're using a terminal, navigate to the program directory and run `g++ program.cpp -o program`.

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled program by executing `./program` in the terminal.

3. **Main Menu**: The program will display a main menu with options to choose from. Select either "Pila" (Stack) or "Cola" (Queue).

4. **Interaction**: Depending on your choice, follow the step-by-step instructions to interact with the stack or queue. You can push, pop, search for values, and more.

5. **Exiting**: To exit the program, choose the "Salir" (Exit) option from the main menu.



## Project 2: Search Algorithms in C++

This C++ program demonstrates various search algorithms for finding elements in an array. It allows you to perform linear search, binary search, and interpolation search on a set of positive even integers stored in an array.

### Features

- **Linear Search:** Performs a linear search to find a target value in the array. It displays the iterations and results of the search.

- **Quick Sort:** Sorts the input array using the quicksort algorithm, making it suitable for binary search.

- **Binary Search:** Performs a binary search on the sorted array to find a target value. It shows the iterations and results of the search.

- **Interpolation Search:** Performs an interpolation search on the sorted array to find a target value. It displays the iterations and results of the search.

- **User Interaction:** Provides a user-friendly menu to choose search methods and input values.

- **Input Validation:** Ensures that input values are positive and even.

### Getting Started

1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the program using a C++ compiler.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled program.

3. **Main Menu:**
   - Choose from the available search methods (linear, binary, interpolation) or exit the program.

4. **Array Input:**
   - Input up to 10 positive even integers into the array.

5. **Search and Results:**
   - Perform searches, and the program will display search iterations and results.

### Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program. Input positive even integers to search for within the array.
