## Project 1: Stack and Queue Implementation

This project implements a stack and a queue data structure, offering various operations for managing and interacting with these data structures.

### Main Features

- **Stack Operations**: Push values onto the stack, search for values, find the smallest and largest values, and pop elements.
- **Queue Operations**: Enqueue values into the queue, search for values, find the smallest and largest values, and dequeue elements.
- **Input Validation**: Input is carefully validated to ensure it meets the required conditions, promoting a smooth and error-free user experience.
- **Modular Structure**: The code is organized into modular functions, each responsible for specific operations, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Getting Started

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. **Compilation**: Compile the program using a C++ compiler. If you're using a terminal, navigate to the program directory and run `g++ program.cpp -o program`.

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled program by executing `./program` in the terminal.

3. **Main Menu**: The program will display a main menu with options to choose from. Select either "Pila" (Stack) or "Cola" (Queue).

4. **Interaction**: Depending on your choice, follow the step-by-step instructions to interact with the stack or queue. You can push, pop, search for values, and more.

5. **Exiting**: To exit the program, choose the "Salir" (Exit) option from the main menu.
